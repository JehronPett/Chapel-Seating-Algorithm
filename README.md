# Chapel-Seating-Algorithm
I wrote this program to help the dean at my high school create an efficient seating chart for our chapel, saving him days of work. This is my first side project, and I know it's not the best looking code and logic. Since I've developed this I've learned a lot more about programming and I think I can optimize this algorithm. Any help would be appreciated.
